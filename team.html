				<h1>Buddy</h1>
				<p>As our Team Manager, Buddy was responsible for keeping the team on track. Buddy also has a huge understanding of SolidWorks so he has doubled up as our Manufacturing engineer, Designing the car on SolidWorks, travelling to Sprowston Academy to mill it out and 3D printing the front and back wings at school. Buddy has worked closely with all of the members in the team to check that we are all on task and if we need help assisting us on our work. Buddy also aided the gathering of sponsorship by going into local businesses asking for sponsorships face to face.</p><br>
				<h1>Lily-Mai</h1>
				<p>As the Cobra Racing Resource Manager, Lily-Mai had the task of securing sponsors, alongside Kieran, and setting up social media platforms. She used her communication skills to talk to companies over the phone and enquire about possible sponsorships. Lily-Mai also had the job of Deputy team manager, to help Buddy with the organisation of the team. Lily-Mai worked closely with most of the members of the team but especially Kieran and Emma whilst gathering sponsorships.</p>
				<h1>Kieran</h1>
				<p>As the Cobra Racing Resource Manager, Kieran was in charge of securing sponsors and keeping check of finances. Kieran set up our GoFundMe page and created many spreadsheets to organise the money coming in and out. Kieran also used his knowledge of PR to write our 2000 word essay, and know-how of programming to create our very own Cobra Racing website from scratch. Kieran worked with Lily-Mai and Emma whilst gathering sponsors, so we could gather more sponsors in the short space of time that we had.</p><br>
				<h1>Emma</h1>
				<p>As our Manufacturing Engineer, Emma was in charge of constructing our pit display. Emma used her understanding of construction and wood work to produce the components of the pit display. She worked with all of the team to gain the information of each aspect of the project to display on the backboards. She too, worked with See-Saw to create and print the backboards for the pit display. Emma helped with sponsors by creating lists of sponsors we needed to email.</p>
				<h1>James</h1>
				<p>As our Design Engineer, James was given with the task of drawing up the initial car design and writing the design portfolio. James is an expert on plane wings and used his knowledge on aerodynamics to, with Buddy, draw up a car which has what they believe to be the most aerodynamic design with the smallest drag possible. James worked closely with Buddy throughout the whole design process to ensure we met all the rules and regulations whilst having the quickest car possible.</p><br>
				<h1>Lucy</h1>
				<p>As our Graphic Designer, Lucy was responsible for the development of the Cobra Racing brand. Lucy drew up initial logo designs and developed the brand from regionals to a more professional standard for nationals. Lucy worked closely with the whole team getting our opinions and thoughts on her designs. She also worked with See-Saw Graphics who sponsored us with help with our logo design and pit display design. In addition Lucy helped with sponsors and social media by emailing companies and setting up our Instagram account.</p><br>
